Aim for our project was to basically create an online exam preparation application
(App) which will help the users (students) to prepare for various regular or competitive
exams.The main aspect that we focus on was to provide such resources and information
to the users so that they can work smartly on the preparation rather than providing
them a full lengthy analysis to every topic which would make the process of studying
difficult during exams.Moreover Exameaze focuses on ‘easing’ the preparation process
to a great extent which could really help the user during the stressful period of exams.
